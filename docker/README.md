# Docker Sub Directory

We use Docker a lot in our workflow and find it useful to start new projects with a couple of our common Docker files. If we are creating a project that does not require them we simply `rm -rf docker` the sub directory.

We will be adding more .dockerfiles to this list to support easy bootstrapping of NodeJS, MongoDb, WordPress, MySQL, etc
